READY-TO-USE PACKAGES

It may be that your distribution offers a ready-to-use package of FFGo. Please
check on its website and contact me (email address at the end of this file) if
this is the case to allow me to mention it here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MANUAL INSTALLATION

This program requires no installation, just unpack the archive anywhere and
make sure that all software requirements are met before the first start. In
the rest of this section, I'll try to guide you through the process of
installing FFGo's dependencies.

- Python 3.x should be available in any Linux distribution (package 'python3',
  or 'python', or 'python3.4', etc.). If your distribution doesn't have
  Python 3.4 or later, download the latest Python version from
  <https://www.python.org/> and compile it following the instructions in the
  README file. You don't need to perform the 'make install' step, you can use
  the 'python' executable obtained in the build directory as is.

- Tkinter is normally shipped with Python when installing from source.
  However, when installing from a Linux distribution package manager, Tkinter
  is often provided as a separate package such as python3-tk or python-tk.

So, these two dependencies should be readily available to anyone who can
install Python 3. There remain two dependencies: CondConfigParser and Pillow.

Note for Windows users:

  Although the author of these lines didn't have a chance to try to run FFGo
  under Windows (please report if you do so), the most appropriate
  installation method seems to be the “Standard procedure” described below.
  Since there is no system Python on Windows, you should be able to use pip
  directly on your Python installation (don't change the default for the
  Python installation folder to avoid permission problems). There should be no
  need to create a virtual environment in this case.

  The “Open Log Directory” feature is not expected to work on Windows, as it
  uses the 'xdg-open' program. However, this is not very important, you can
  open the log directory with any file manager.


Easiest procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the usually simplest installation method, you can omit Pillow, which is
nice but optional—only used to display aircraft thumbnails. As for
CondConfigParser, the standard installation method is based on pip (see
below), but you can install it for FFGo only, using the following steps:

  1. Unpack the CondConfigParser archive wherever you want, under your normal
     user account:

       cd ~/src
       tar -xjf CondConfigParser-x.y.z.tar.bz2

     (assuming you downloaded the tarball as
     ~/src/CondConfigParser-x.y.z.tar.bz2)

  2. Do the same with the FFGo archive:

       cd ~/src
       tar -xzf FFGo-a.b.c.tar.gz

  3. Create a symbolic link to allow FFGo to find CondConfigParser:

       ln -s ~/src/CondConfigParser-x.y.z/condconfigparser \
             ~/src/FFGo-a.b.c/condconfigparser

     (assuming the previous step created the ~/src/FFGo-a.b.c directory,
     leaving the ffgo executable script at ~/src/FFGo-a.b.c/ffgo)

That's all! You should be able to run the ffgo executable mentioned in step 3.
In case you need to explicitely specify the Python interpreter to use, you can
do so with a command such as:

  python3.4 ~/src/FFGo-a.b.c/ffgo


Standard procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure makes you install FFGo's dependencies in a more standard way,
using pip. Depending on your configuration, the initial setup may be more
complicated, but once this first step completed, it will make it very easy to
see when a given dependency is out of date and, if you so desire, to upgrade
it. So, we have two remaining dependencies to install:

- CondConfigParser: if you already have a working pip setup (see appendix),
  all you need to do is:

    pip install CondConfigParser

- The last remaining dependency is Pillow, and it is optional (used to display
  aircraft thumbnails). You can either get it as a package from your
  distribution or install it yourself with pip (the package name is
  python3-pil.imagetk in Debian, sometimes python3-imaging-tk, this depends on
  the distribution).

  a) In the first case (getting Pillow as a package), if you are working in a
     virtual environment, you'll probably have to (re-)create that virtual
     environment with the '--system-site-packages' option in order to make
     system-installed packages visible to the virtual environment.

  b) In the second case (installing Pillow yourself), assuming you already
     have a working pip setup (see appendix), all you need to do is:

    * Install the programs and/or libraries necessary for Pillow's
      compilation. On Debian unstable (July 2015), the following is likely to
      be sufficent:

        # apt-get install libpython3-dev tcl-dev tk-dev
        (tcl8.6-dev and tk8.6-dev can do as well)

      or, installing more packages:

        # apt-get build-dep python3-pil.imagetk

    * Then, you should be able to run:

        pip install Pillow

    Of course, these are just hints; the authoritative source for this
    installation procedure is Pillow's documentation.

What is a "working pip setup"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous paragraphs, a few instructions have been given assuming you
had a "working pip setup". In the last 15 years, the Python ecosystem has
grown several frameworks for packaging Python software in a distribution and
OS-agnostic way, each of which offers a different way of installing said
software for the users. With distutils, the user had to run "setup.py
install"; later, with setuptools, he had to install and use a program named
easy_install. Today, the winning framework seems to be a combination of
setuptools and pip, the latter offering the end-user interface for installing,
upgrading and removing Python-made software (setuptools being used internally,
in a way that is not directly visible to the user).

All this to say that there are many ways to install Python-made software, even
on the same operating system. Each way having its own upsides and downsides,
this makes it difficult to give simple and clear installation instructions
understandable by non-Pythonistas, in our case for Pillow and
CondConfigParser.

The method I am giving hints about here is the one relying on the
setuptools+pip combination, because:
  - it is basically officially endorsed by the Python project, since the
    inclusion of ensurepip in Python 3.4;
  - once properly setup, it allows easy installation, upgrade and removal of
    packages into or from a particular Python installation.

Before diving into details, you may want to consult the official Python
end-user documentation concerning installation of Python modules:

  <https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html>

(which is not FFGo-specific, but may prove useful anyway)

So, you have a Python installation and want to install FFGo and its
dependencies to use this installation. The first thing you need to know is how
to invoke its Python interpreter from a command line. This may be 'python',
'python3', 'python3.4', or a full path such as '/opt/python3/bin/python',
'/home/tartampion/src/Python-3.4.3/python', etc. I can't guess it for you, it
depends on how you installed this particular Python interpreter. For the
following paragraphs, we'll assume it is 'python3'.

First, check the version of this interpreter and make sure it is compatible
with the requirements stated in the README file:

  % python3 --version
  Python 3.4.3

(here, the '% ' represents a normal user prompt: there is no need to run this
command as super-user)

Now that you have precisely identified the Python installation to use, you
could theoretically use pip to install Python packages into it, BUT there is
one thing that requires paying attention to before doing so:

  - If this Python installation was installed all by yourself, i.e., *not*
    through a package manager such as dpkg/apt-get, rpm/yum, etc., then all is
    fine. pip is probably already installed; and if for some reason, it is
    not, you can make it available with:

      % python3 -m ensurepip

    as explained at <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html>.
    Then, run the command:

      % python3 -m pip --version

    to make sure it is going to act on the Python installation you want, and
    not for instance on the Python installed by your package manager. It
    should print something like this:

      pip 7.0.3 from /home/tartampion/python-venv/default-3/lib/python3.4/site-packages (python 3.4)

    If the path starts with /usr/lib, don't use that pip (unless you know what
    you are doing), as that would modify your system Python installation.

    Depending on your installation, it may be that the 'pip', or 'pip3', or
    'pip3.4', etc. command is equivalent to 'python3 -m pip'. Simply run the
    commands with the '--version' option as above to make sure which Python
    installation they are working on.

  - On the other hand, if the Python interpreter was installed with your
    distribution package manager, it is advised *not* to use pip directly on
    this installation, as it could cause problems by stepping on the package
    manager's toes. However, there is a way to prevent this conflict between
    pip and the distribution package manager: using pip inside a virtual
    environment. As a bonus, this method allows to install, upgrade and remove
    Python packages under a normal user account (no need for root privileges).

    Quoting <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv-def>:

      A virtual environment (also called a venv) is a Python environment such
      that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are
      isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by
      default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python, i.e. one which is
      installed as part of your operating system.

    In other words, you may create as many virtual environments from a given
    “base” Python installation as you want. Then, when you install, upgrade or
    remove a Python package from one of these virtual environments, it will
    have no effect on the other virtual environments nor on the base
    installation. Since virtual environment creation and package installation
    with pip is very quick and easy, virtual environments are quite convenient
    to experiment with Python packages without taking the risk of messing up
    your system.

    Python 3.3 and later ship with the 'venv' module to create and manage
    virtual environments, so this is what we are going to use here. To create
    a virtual environment (venv) in subdirectory 'foo-venv' of the current
    directory, you can simply run:

      % python3 -m venv foo-venv

    (depending on your setup, something like 'pyvenv foo-venv' may do the
    same, but you have to make sure it uses the base installation you want in
    case you have several Python installations)

    Once this is done, you'll have a few executables in the 'foo-venv/bin'
    directory, in particular 'python' and probably also 'pip' (if 'pip' is not
    present, run 'foo-venv/bin/python -m ensurepip'). Whenever you run one of
    these programs, it will use the 'foo-venv' virtual environment. Therefore,
    if you want to install the CondConfigParser Python package inside
    'foo-venv', you can do:

      % foo-venv/bin/pip install CondConfigParser

    If you want to remove it:

      % foo-venv/bin/pip uninstall CondConfigParser

    If you want to upgrade it (-U is equivalent to --upgrade):

      % foo-venv/bin/pip install --upgrade CondConfigParser

    To see the list of packages seen by pip in the 'foo-venv' venv:

      % foo-venv/bin/pip list

    And to obtain the list of packages for which a newer version is available
    on the Python Package Index (PyPI, <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>):

      % foo-venv/bin/pip list --outdated

    For installing Pillow, this is the same:

      % foo-venv/bin/pip install Pillow

    except you have to make sure you have the required libraries installed on
    your OS before, because this command compiles Pillow in the 'foo-venv'
    virtual environment (something like
    'apt-get install libpython3-dev tcl-dev tk-dev' is likely to to the trick
    on Debian).

    Notes:
      - if you have many commands to run using the same venv, 'foo-venv' in
        our case, and you don't want to type the 'foo-venv/bin/' prefix every
        time, you can run 'source foo-venv/bin/activate' in your shell. Then,
        the commands from 'foo-venv/bin' will take precedence in this shell
        until you run 'deactivate'. Note that this relies on a modification of
        the PATH environment variable and may need to be done differently on
        exotic shells.
      - if you have a 'pip', or 'pip3', or 'pip3.4'... in your PATH and want
        to know which Python installation it is bound to, simply run it with
        the '--version' option, as in 'pip --version'.
      - by default, a newly created venv has access to the Python standard
        library only. It is possible, however, to create venvs that have
        access to all packages of the base installation used to create the
        venv. In order to do this, you have to pass the
        '--system-site-packages' option to the venv creation command, as in:

          % python3 -m venv --system-site-packages foo-venv

    Once you have all dependencies installed in your venv, you will want to
    run FFGo using the Python interpreter from this venv. The most
    straightforward way to do this is to run:

      % foo-venv/bin/python /path/to/ffgo

    After checking this works fine, you may want to create an alias for this
    command or a launcher script such as:

      #! /path/to/foo-venv/bin/python

      import os, sys
      os.execv("/path/to/ffgo", ["ffgo"] + sys.argv[1:])

    or an equivalent shell script:

      #! /bin/sh

      exec /path/to/foo-venv/bin/python /path/to/ffgo "$@"


Maintenance of a virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally, venvs don't need much maintenance except for keeping them
up-to-date, as you should already do with your distribution. In short:

  % foo-venv/bin/pip list --outdated
  % foo-venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pkg1 pkg2 ...

In case a venv stops working after an update of the underlying base
installation, 'python3 -m venv --upgrade foo-venv' might be helpful.
Otherwise, you can keep a little script around that contains all commands you
used to create and populate your venv. Since venv creation is very quick, you
can rerun the script whenever needed.

INSTALLATION FROM THE GIT REPOSITORY

First, make sure you have the following programs installed in addition to the
dependencies listed in the README_ll file (where 'll' stands for the language
code of your choice):
  - GNU Make
  - GNU gettext
  - librsvg's rsvg-convert program

Then download the source code:

  cd /some/directory
  git clone https://github.com/frougon/FFGo.git

(alternatively, you may download a Zip-compressed snapshot of the repository
by clicking on "Download ZIP" at <https://github.com/frougon/FFGo>)

Then prepare the source (icons and translation files) with:

  cd FFGo
  make

This 'make' run in the top-level directory must be done after each 'git clone'
or 'git pull' operation. From this point on, you can follow the instructions
given in the MANUAL INSTALLATION section.

Optional: if you have Sphinx installed and want to generate the HTML version
          of the 'README.conditional-config' document, you can run:

            make doc

          from the same (top-level) directory. The result will end up in
          'docs/README.conditional-config.source/_build/html'.

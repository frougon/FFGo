## List of 'fgfs' command line options. Enable the options you want to use by

## Enter your callsign. Note that it's currently limited to seven characters.
## Please don't choose a callsign already in use by someone else on the

## By default, if you are connected to the Internet, the current weather
## information (METAR) is automatically retrieved on FlightGear startup. If
## you want to choose yourself precise weather conditions (for instance to
## practice crosswind takeoffs or landings), you can use the --metar option.
##
## Note: if your FlightGear version is older than 2016.2.1, then you also have
##       to disable automatic fetching of weather data; otherwise, the --metar
##       option is ineffective.
#--metar=LOWI 212150Z 26004KT 9999 FEW035 BKN050 06/02 Q1014 NOSIG

## Enable the Phi web interface to FlightGear. To use it, start FlightGear and
## point your web browser to <http://127.0.0.1:8080/>. Firefox is well
## supported; for other browsers, it may vary---at the time of this writing.
## Note: this causes FlightGear to act as an HTTP server.
##
#--httpd=127.0.0.1:8080       # allow local access only (maximum security)
#--httpd=8080                 # the web interface can be accessed from other
##                            # computers.
##
## 127.0.0.1 is an address that is only accessible from your computer
## (loopback). If you are going to run the web browser from the same computer
## as the one running FlightGear, use the first form (--httpd=127.0.0.1:8080).
## Otherwise, if you want to run Phi on a different computer (or smartphone,
## or whatever), then you have to use the second form or a variant of the
## first form with 127.0.0.1 replaced with a suitable address (the HTTP server
## in FlightGear will bind its listening socket to that address; thus, it has
## to be the address of a local interface of the computer running FlightGear).
## See <http://wiki.flightgear.org/Phi> for more details.

## Limit the number of frames per second to the specified value.
#--max-fps=60

## FOR AIRCRAFT DEVELOPERS
## You can test multiplayer functionality of an aircraft using only one
## computer and no Internet access---it is not even needed to connect to a
## multiplayer server. For this, you'll have to run FlightGear under two
## different user accounts at the same time. For the first FlightGear
## instance, you can use this:
##
#--callsign=test1
#--multiplay=out,10,127.0.0.1,5001
#--multiplay=in,10,127.0.0.1,5000
##
## On the second instance (run by a different user!), use this instead:
##
#--callsign=test2
#--multiplay=out,10,127.0.0.1,5000
#--multiplay=in,10,127.0.0.1,5001
##
## See <http://wiki.flightgear.org/Howto:Multiplayer> for more details.

## FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
## More information about 'fgfs' (FlightGear) command line options
## can be found:
##   - with the command 'fgfs --help --verbose', which FFGo can run for you
##     (Help menu, then choose "Show available fgfs options" at the time of
##     this writing);

##   - or at <https://wiki.flightgear.org/Command_line_options>.

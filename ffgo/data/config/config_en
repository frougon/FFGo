## List of 'fgfs' command line options. Enable the options you want to use by
## removing the hash symbol at the beginning of the appropriate lines.

## RENDERING OPTIONS
## Enable fullscreen mode.
#--enable-fullscreen

## Specify the geometry of FlightGear's window (no need to specify it if you
## use --enable-fullscreen).
#--geometry=800x600

## Enable anti-aliasing. This can improve the visual quality of FlightGear's
## rendering, especially at low resolutions, but is also likely to reduce the
## frame rate. See <http://wiki.flightgear.org/Anti-aliasing> for details.
#--prop:/sim/rendering/multi-sample-buffers=true
#--prop:/sim/rendering/multi-samples=4

## OTHER
## Enter your callsign. Note that it's currently limited to seven characters.
## Please don't choose a callsign already in use by someone else on the
## multiplayer network.
#--callsign=

## Enable automatic scenery download as you fly:
#--enable-terrasync
## ... or disable it in case it causes problems, or you just can't use it
## (for instance, if you are not connected to the Internet).
#--disable-terrasync
## See <http://wiki.flightgear.org/TerraSync> for more details.

## If you want to choose the directory used for automatic scenery download.
##
## Note: in FlightGear 2016.1.1, setting this to a directory that is not under
##       FG_HOME may cause failure to read some scenery files, due to
##       inadequate permissions rules[1]. This has normally been fixed[2] in
##       FlightGear commit 41b78ce1505aced494f588d6f3591c8af68a8bbe (dated
##       Sunday, Feb 21), therefore FlightGear 2016.2.1 and later should not
##       be affected.

## You can choose the start time of day for your flight.
#--timeofday=noon

## Summer and winter use different textures.
#--season=summer

## By default, if you are connected to the Internet, the current weather
## information (METAR) is automatically retrieved on FlightGear startup. If
## you want to choose yourself precise weather conditions (for instance to
## practice crosswind takeoffs or landings), you can use the --metar option.
##
## Note: if your FlightGear version is older than March 20, 2016 (FlightGear
##       commit 0cfa4ced9cd5e2ec26e753ddd5f61da7558221a6, which belongs to
##       FlightGear 2016.2.0), then you have to also use
##       --disable-real-weather-fetch; otherwise, the --metar option is
##       ineffective.

## You may find the 2D Head-Up Display more readable than the 3D one.

#--disable-hud-3d

## Enable the Phi web interface to FlightGear. To use it, start FlightGear and
## point your web browser to <http://127.0.0.1:8080/>. Firefox is well
## supported; for other browsers, it may vary---at the time of this writing.
## Note: this causes FlightGear to act as an HTTP server.
##
#--httpd=127.0.0.1:8080       # allow local access only (maximum security)
#--httpd=8080                 # the web interface can be accessed from other
##                            # computers.
##
## 127.0.0.1 is an address that is only accessible from your computer
## (loopback). If you are going to run the web browser from the same computer
## as the one running FlightGear, use the first form (--httpd=127.0.0.1:8080).
## Otherwise, if you want to run Phi on a different computer (or smartphone,
## or whatever), then you have to use the second form or a variant of the
## first form with 127.0.0.1 replaced with a suitable address (the HTTP server
## in FlightGear will bind its listening socket to that address; thus, it has
## to be the address of a local interface of the computer running FlightGear).
## See <http://wiki.flightgear.org/Phi> for more details.

## Limit fps to the specified number.

## FOR AIRCRAFT DEVELOPERS
## You can test multiplayer functionality of an aircraft using only one
## computer and no Internet access---it is not even needed to connect to a
## multiplayer server. For this, you'll have to run FlightGear under two
## different user accounts at the same time. For the first FlightGear
## instance, you can use this:
##
#--callsign=test1
#--multiplay=out,10,127.0.0.1,5001
#--multiplay=in,10,127.0.0.1,5000
##
## On the second instance (run by a different user!), use this instead:
##
#--callsign=test2
#--multiplay=out,10,127.0.0.1,5000
#--multiplay=in,10,127.0.0.1,5001
##
## See <http://wiki.flightgear.org/Howto:Multiplayer> for more details.

## FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
## More information about 'fgfs' (FlightGear) command line options
## can be found:
##   - with the command 'fgfs --help --verbose', which FFGo can run for you
##     (Help menu, then choose "Show available fgfs options" at the time of
##     this writing);
##   - in the FlightGear documentation;
##   - or at <http://wiki.flightgear.org/index.php/Command_Line_Options>.
